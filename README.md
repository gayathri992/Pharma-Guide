### Project Description
PharmaGuide is a web application designed to provide users with detailed information about medicines. The application allows users to search for medicines and view comprehensive details such as uses, dosage, warnings, and side effects.


### The Problem statement
Accessing reliable medicine information is challenging due to scattered and inconsistent data.
Many platforms lack user-friendly interfaces for specific drug details.
Complex medical terminology makes understanding labels difficult for most users.

### The Solution
Centralized Data: Say goodbye to endless searches! All essential medicine details are available in one place.
User-Friendly Interface: Searching for medicine is now as simple as typing a name and clicking a button.
Dynamic Visuals: A vibrant design and animations make exploring medicine details engaging and enjoyable.
Simplified Medical Jargon: Information is presented in easy-to-understand language for everyone.
